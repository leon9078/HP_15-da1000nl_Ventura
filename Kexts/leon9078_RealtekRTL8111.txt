Use my version, which added support for WoL from S5, thx @jpz4085!

In macOS, Wake on LAN from sleep is controlled by the system setting "Wake for network access" (pmset "womp"). The same is applied by default for WoL from S5.
To force-enable WoL from S5 use `rtl8111-wol-override=1` boot-arg.
To force-disable WoL from S5 use `rtl8111-wol-override=0` boot-arg.
